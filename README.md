#### data (directory = folder)

Store data given from competition website in this directory (i.e. folder).

#### sample-r

Sample code / script files in R. May contain basic structure of executing / printing / formating / etc various machine learning and data analysis techniques. For example: the <strong>sample-cart.R</strong> file contains general code for basic decision tree (including printing).

This directory also contains the <strong>TrainTest.RData</strong> given from the competition website. This contains a compact dataset that is a subset of the <strong>MaskedData.npz</strong> file. This compact dataset contains only 50,000 observations for training. To use:

```
    load("TrainTest.RData")
    # X, y, & XTest
```

#### data-mod-log

This directory (i.e. folder) contains data files that we have modified. In addition, it contains a markdown file that has a written description of all of the modifications / changes we have made or algorithms we have attempted (with results / insight).
